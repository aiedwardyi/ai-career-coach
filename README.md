Note: .env and my_env/ are intentionally excluded from version control.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
* Python 3.11 (or compatible 3.x version)

* A valid IBM Cloud / watsonx.ai account and API key

* Git (if you want to clone and contribute)

## ⚙️ Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-career-coach.git
cd ai-career-coach
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv my_env
# Windows PowerShell
.\my_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# or Command Prompt
my_env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Install dependencies

* If you have requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Or install core packages manually:

```bash
pip install gradio==5.12.0 ibm-watsonx-ai==1.1.20 python-dotenv \ email-validator==2.1.1 numpy==1.26.4 pandas==2.1.4
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root (same folder as the .py files) with:

```text
IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_ibm_api_key_here
IBM_WATSONX_URL=https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com
IBM_WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
MODEL_ID=meta-llama/llama-3-2-11b-vision-instruct
```

* Do not commit .env to version control.

* These variables are loaded in the scripts using python-dotenv.

## ▶️ How to Run
From the project root, with your virtual environment active:

## General chat application

```bash
python llm_chat.py
```

## Resume polisher

```bash
python resume_polisher.py
```

## Cover letter generator

```bash
python cover_letter.py
```

## Career advisor

```bash
python career_advisor.py
```

## Simple Gradio demo

```bash
python gradio_demo.py
```

Each script will start a local Gradio web app and print a URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) that you can open in your browser.

## 🧪 Testing & Development Notes
* Scripts are structured to read configuration from .env using python-dotenv.

* Temperature and max_tokens parameters are set per use case:

    * Lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) for more deterministic answers.
    * Higher temperature (e.g., 0.7) for more creative text (e.g., cover letters).

* You can tweak these in the TextChatParameters in each script.

## 📦 Dependencies (summary)
Key libraries used:

* gradio – Web UI for interacting with the models.

* ibm-watsonx-ai – IBM watsonx.ai SDK for accessing foundation models.

* python-dotenv – Loads environment variables from .env.

* numpy, pandas, email-validator – Utility libraries used in parts of the course/project.
